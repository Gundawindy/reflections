When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

*When you want to access it from multiple computers or allow others to work on the project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

*You might not always want changes that are made, there may be a lot of contributors and it may be overwhelming.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

*Forks are when you copy an already existing repository on Github. Clones are when you copy an existing repository from Github to a local PC or the other way. Branches are when you make a change in an existing repository but want to be able to continue making other changes from the previous point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

*If you are offline you still have a copy of the last known Github copy.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

*Create a new branch and use a pull request.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

*If you're making a change that you aren't sure about then it might be best to use a seperate branch. After you confirm that the change is doing what you expected then you can merge it back into the master branch.
